Kuali Code Exercise

I tried to limit my work to 2 hours, though I forgot to set a timer to track my progress. I implemented 
most of the features requested in the exercise PDF, but didn't get to make a 'simulation' aspect or add 
times/delays to make #7 possible - i.e., calling an elevator that is already moving.
